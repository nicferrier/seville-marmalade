= Bits for making Marmalade =

The marmalade Emacs repository system is relatively complex. Complex
enough that I've puppeted and vagrantified it.

This repo contains the workings.

See the Rakefile for more information.

The vagrant box used is my own centos 6 box. Please ask for it if you
want it.
